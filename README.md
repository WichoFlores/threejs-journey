# Three.js Journey by Bruno Simon

Welcome to the **Three.js Journey** repository! This repository contains projects, exercises, and notes inspired by Bruno Simon's renowned course on mastering **Three.js**, a JavaScript 3D library for creating interactive 3D experiences on the web.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **Getting Started**
- **Setup Instructions**: Code for setting up a basic Three.js project.
- **Hello World Example**: The foundational Three.js scene, camera, and renderer setup.

### 2. **Core Concepts**
- **Geometries and Materials**: Examples showcasing various geometries and materials.
- **Lighting**: Implementation of ambient, point, spot, and directional lights.
- **Textures**: Applying textures, UV mapping, and optimizations.

### 3. **Intermediate Projects**
- **Animation Basics**: Animating objects using the `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
- **Camera Controls**: Integrating `OrbitControls` for interactive camera movement.
- **Particle Systems**: Creating particle effects using shaders and custom geometries.

### 4. **Advanced Techniques**
- **Custom Shaders**: Examples of vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Post-Processing**: Using the `EffectComposer` for effects like bloom and depth of field.
- **Physics**: Integration with libraries like `Cannon.js` or `Ammo.js`.

### 5. **Mini Projects**
- **Interactive 3D Website**: A basic interactive website using Three.js.
- **3D Game Prototype**: A simple game concept leveraging Three.js capabilities.
